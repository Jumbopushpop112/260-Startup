      <p>Slime was first developed in January of 2026 by Matthew Hart, a CS student at BYU. It's a startup project, aimed to help people have a fun and free time communicating with their friends
        I'm so grateful for all the support that I have been given with this project. This is my first attempt at a nice website for users, and I know that with patience and hard work, I can succeed.
